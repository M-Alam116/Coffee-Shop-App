# React Native Coffee Shop App

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository and get started with the Coffee Shop App in React Native, follow these instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Alam116/Coffee-Shop-App.git
```

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

## Implementation of Coffee Shop App in React Native

### Technology Stack

Coffee Shop App is developed using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. React Native allows developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android, thereby reducing development time and effort. It enables the development of native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. Additionally, TypeScript is utilized for type-safe development. TypeScript enhances the development process by adding static typing to JavaScript, providing improved code quality, editor support, and type safety throughout the app's development lifecycle. This combination of React Native and TypeScript facilitates efficient and robust development, allowing for the creation of cross-platform mobile applications with enhanced reliability and maintainability.

### Additional Packages Used

1. **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**: Asynchronous storage operations for persistently storing and retrieving data on the device.
2. **@react-native-community/blur**: Components for creating blur effects in the app's UI.
3. **@react-native-firebase/app, @react-native-firebase/auth, @react-native-firebase/firestore, @react-native-firebase/storage**: Firebase SDK for React Native for integrating Firebase services into the app.
4. **@react-navigation/bottom-tabs, @react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/native-stack**: React Navigation for implementing navigation within the app.
5. **immer**: Utilities for working with immutable data structures, enhancing performance and simplifying state management.
6. **lottie-react-native**: Integration of Lottie animations into the app for high-quality, vector-based animations.
7. **react, react-native**: Core dependencies for React Native app development.
8. **react-native-document-picker**: Facilitates document picking functionality in the app.
9. **react-native-linear-gradient**: Creates linear gradient backgrounds and effects in the app's UI.
10. **react-native-safe-area-context, react-native-screens, react-native-splash-screen**: Packages for handling device-specific UI constraints and optimizations.
11. **react-native-vector-icons**: Collection of customizable icons for use in the app's UI.
12. **zustand**: Minimalistic yet powerful state management solution for React applications.
